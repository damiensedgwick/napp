## About
**What is a Nano App?**
A Nano App is the name I dedicded to give a particular type of application that I am interested in
researching and developing. The constraints are quite simple, it must have as few files as possible
to function correctly, it can be containerised with as small image as possible and it must use as
little JavaScript as possible.

Below are some potential use cases for a Nano App.

### Rapid Prototyping:

**Idea Validation** - Quickly build a minimal working prototype to test the core
functionality of an app idea. This is great for validating assumptions before investing in a full-scale
project. 

**UI/UX Experimentation** - Use HTMX's dynamic capabilities to experiment with different user interface
flows and interactions without heavy JavaScript reliance.

**Proof of Concepts** - Create lightweightapps to showcase the feasibility of a technical concept for
clients or team members.

### Small-Scale Internal Tools:

**Custom Dashboards** - Build dashboards to monitor internal metrics, system statuses, or visualize data.
SQLite's simplicity makes it perfect for storing and querying relevant information.

**Admin Interfaces** - Develop basic admin panels to manage users, content, or configuration settings for
internal systems.
    
**Workflow Automation** - Create simple tools to automate repetitive tasks, such as data processing or
report generation.

### Personal Projects:

**Habit Trackers** - Build a lightweight web app to track personal habits, goals, or progress (e.g.,
logging workouts, reading, etc.).

**Recipe Books** - Create a personal recipe manager where you can store, search, and categorize your
favorite recipes.

**Simple Note-taking Apps** - Develop a basic notes app for jotting down ideas, to-dos, or reminders.

### Learning and Experimentation:

**Go Practice** - Use Napp as a framework to build small projects and improve your Go coding skills and
web development techniques.

**HTMX Exploration** - Explore the power of HTMX for building reactive interfaces with minimal JavaScript.

**Database Fundamentals** - Learn and apply basic database concepts with SQLite for data storage and retrieval.
