## About
**What is a Nano App?** - A Nano App is the name I dedicded to give a particular type of application
that I am interested in researching and developing. The constraints are quite simple, it must have as
few files as possible to function correctly, it can be containerised with as small image as possible
and it must use as little JavaScript as possible.

**What is the stack?** - The current stack, is Go, HTMX and SQLite. With these technologies, I am
looking to be able to provide a way to easily replicate a projects structure and setup so that I can
build out prototypes for ideas, as quickly as possible.

## Prerequisites
- Go 1.22 or higher (It may work on older versions of Go, I developed it using this version).
- Make sure your Go bin is added to your path so that installed packages can be used globally.

## Installation
- go install github.com/damiensedgwick/napp
